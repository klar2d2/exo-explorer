## Exo-Explorer

Take a look at the stars as seen by Gaia 2! The mission of this project is to visualize the stars in the sky with an interactive exoplanet searcher! Zoom in on swathes of the sky to take a closer look at confirmed exoplanets. With over 4,000 confirmed exoplanets orbiting foreign stars there is plenty of systems to explore.
